      <ul class="links" herf="index.html">My Story</ul>My name is Asher, i'm a phoenix I was driven out of my home (A volcano) by a pack of dragons. I fought back but the dragons outnumberd me and I was defeted. I was forced out of my volcano. I had to fly away to find a new volcano. As I looked I noticed that human towns were growing and there seemed to be less animals. I saw acuple of my old frends and asked them where they were going. They said there homes were destroid by humans. This was strange because humans usialy leave mithical animals alone so I dicided to leave the humans alone. It took awile to find a volcano but eventuially found one away from humans. THE END</li>
